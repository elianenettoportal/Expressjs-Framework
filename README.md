# ExpressJS_Framework

There is a framework built on top of Express.js called "Express.js Application Generator". 
It's a command-line interface (CLI) tool that helps you quickly create an Express.js web application with a basic directory structure and starter code.

The application generator uses the Handlebars template engine and includes features such as middleware support, routing, static file serving, and error handling. 
It also comes with basic authentication functionality.

To use the Express.js Application Generator, you first need to install it globally using npm:
npm install -g express-generator

After installation, you can create a new Express.js application by running the following command:
express myapp

This will create a new directory called "myapp" with the basic structure and code for an Express.js application. You can then run the application using:
cd myapp
npm install
npm start


This will start the server and you can access your application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
